## Categories Implemented
### Movement/Physics
#### Implemented player movement mechanics:
- `WASD` for directional movement.
- `Space/Shift` for Rolling.
    - Rolls in the direction of the current player input `(W,A,S,D)` have to be pressed with `Space/Shift`
    - Utilized Lerping to smooth out rolling speed.
- Helped create and augment collisions with Eric to fit the obstacles on the map accurately.
#### Implemented zombie movement mechanics:
Flocking/Seperation making the zombies not group up too close with each other, creating more of a threat and avoids stacking/overlaying sprites.

### Animation
- Added animator controllers, and setting up animations
    - Player, included animations of `Idle`, `Walking`, `Rolling`
    - Zombies, included animations of `Idle`, `Walking`, `Dying`
        - **Default**
        - **Archer**
        - **Wizard**: Contains a `Attack` animation
        - **Giant**
    - Power Ups Pick Ups
        - **Health**
        - **Damage**
        - **Speed**
        - **Range**
    - Also created a animation for pop up text indicating to the player what power is picked up and it's use.

### Map Design
Created starter map for testing meanwhile the Artist was developing our tileset, so we could start testing and implementing features of the game.

Later used Tileset provided by Teamâ€™s Artist (Nicholas Pham) to reconstruct a reimagined wasted version of the Quad in Davis, California.

### Game Logic
- Created Power Up Spawner that spawns a power up after every wave.
    - Generates a randomly selected power up `Health`, `Damage`, `Speed`, `Range`.
    - Plays a sound queue and a indicator of what the power up upgrade for the player.
- Created a Player States for the Player Controller, to keep track of what the player could and could not do within each state `Normal`, `Rolling`,`Stunned` ,`Dead`.
- Handled collision with Zombies
    - Altered the collision hit box to be accurate.
    - Insured that the zombies would only do damage when the zombie was alive and not in death animation.
